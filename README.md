Data Cleaning and Transformation Project: Shop Sales Dataset
In this project, I demonstrated my proficiency in data cleaning and preparation using Microsoft Excel to transform a messy 300-row coffee shop sales dataset into a reliable, analysis-ready format. This process involved multiple steps that showcased my attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and expertise in leveraging Excel’s powerful features for real-world data manipulation.

Key Steps and Skills Demonstrated
1. Removing Duplicates
Action: Used Excel’s Remove Duplicates feature under the Data tab to eliminate identical records (e.g., OrderID 1001 and
1010).
Skills: Efficient use of built-in tools to ensure data integrity and uniqueness.
2. Standardizing Text Formatting
Action: Applied the TRIM() function to remove extra spaces and the PROPER() function to correct inconsistent capitalization (e.g., " Iced Tea " → "Iced Tea").
Skills: Proficiency in text functions to clean and standardize string data.
3. Correcting Typos and Inconsistencies
Action: Manually corrected typos in products (e.g., "Cappucino" → "Cappuccino") and locations (e.g., "LA", "Los Angeles", "la" → "Los Angeles") using Find & Replace.
Skills: Attention to detail and ability to identify and rectify inconsistencies in categorical data.
4. Cleaning Customer Type Categories
Action: Replaced variations like "prem", "regular", and blank cells with consistent labels ("Premium" and "Regular") using IF statements and the LOWER() function.
Skills: Logical reasoning and formula-based cleaning to standardize categorical variables.
5. Fixing Data Types and Invalid Entries
Action: Converted text-formatted numbers to numeric values using the Text to Columns feature and removed symbols like $ and commas from UnitPrice and TotalSales using Find & Replace.
Skills: Expertise in handling mixed data types and ensuring numerical consistency.
6. Handling Missing Values
Action: Identified missing values in Quantity and Rating. Imputed logical defaults (e.g., 0 for quantity) or excluded unreliable entries where necessary.
Skills: Strategic decision-making on how to handle missing data to maintain data quality.
7. Validating and Correcting TotalSales
Action: Created a temporary column to verify if Quantity × UnitPrice = TotalSales. Fixed mismatches to ensure accurate calculations.
Skills: Logical validation and error correction to maintain data integrity.
8. Enforcing Valid Rating Ranges
Action: Filtered out ratings below 1 or above 6 (e.g., 0 or 6) and replaced invalid entries like "N/A" or "4.9.1" with NULL or average values.
Skills: Data validation techniques to enforce business rules and ensure consistency.
9. Extracting a Calendar Table
Action: Used Power Query to extract a calendar table from the Date column, enabling advanced time-based analysis.
Skills: Integration of Power Query for enhanced data transformation capabilities.
10. Adding Calculated Columns
Action: Introduced calculated columns like Satisfaction Rating to enrich the dataset and facilitate deeper insights.
Skills: Ability to derive new metrics and enhance data usability for analysis.
Outcome and Impact
Through these meticulous steps, I transformed raw, inconsistent data into a clean, structured dataset ready for analysis. This process not only ensured data accuracy but also highlighted my proficiency in:

Excel Functions: 
TRIM(), PROPER(), IF(), LOWER(), TEXT TO COLUMNS, and FIND & REPLACE.
Data Validation Techniques: Identifying and correcting errors, enforcing business rules, and handling missing values.
Advanced Features: Leveraging Power Query for complex transformations and creating derived metrics.
This project exemplifies my commitment to delivering high-quality data preparation, which is essential for informed decision-making and effective data-driven strategies.

Conclusion
By showcasing this comprehensive data cleaning process, I aim to demonstrate my versatility and expertise in preparing datasets for analysis. Whether it’s removing duplicates, standardizing text, or validating calculations, my approach ensures that every step contributes to building a robust foundation for actionable insights. This skill set is invaluable in any data-centric role, making me a reliable asset for teams focused on transforming raw data into meaningful results.
